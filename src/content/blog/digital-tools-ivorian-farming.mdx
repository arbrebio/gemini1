# How Digital Tools Are Transforming Ivorian Farming

Agriculture in Côte d'Ivoire is undergoing a significant transformation through the adoption of digital technologies. From simple mobile applications to sophisticated satellite-based systems, digital tools are helping Ivorian farmers overcome traditional challenges and embrace more efficient, profitable, and sustainable farming practices.

## The Digital Agriculture Landscape in Côte d'Ivoire

Côte d'Ivoire's agricultural sector, which employs approximately 60% of the workforce and contributes about 20% to the GDP, is increasingly embracing digital solutions. According to the Digital Agriculture Profile (DAP) for Côte d'Ivoire, the country has seen a 45% increase in digital agriculture adoption over the past five years, driven by:

- Expanding mobile network coverage (now reaching over 90% of the population)
- Increasing smartphone penetration (growing at 15% annually)
- Government initiatives like PNIA II and PSNDEA that promote agricultural digitalization
- Private sector investments in agtech solutions

This digital transformation is occurring across the entire agricultural value chain, from pre-production planning to post-harvest management and market access.
